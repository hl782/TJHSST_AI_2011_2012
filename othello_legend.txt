Idea from "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp" by Peter Norvig.

The board is 8x8:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Imagine a grid that is 10x10:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

If we number these squares from 0 to 99, then the actual "board" is the squares 11-18, 21-28, ..., 81-88.

The tens digit tells us the row and the units digit tells us the column.

We can figure out directions:

+------+------+------+
| n-11 | n-10 |  n-9 |
+------+------+------+
|  n-1 |  n   |  n+1 |
+------+------+------+
|  n+9 | n+10 | n+11 |
+------+------+------+

Also we can put "outer" pieces along the outside edge so we'll know when we've gone off the "board".

Thus, the initial board is:
[
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
]

Black (1) moves first.
